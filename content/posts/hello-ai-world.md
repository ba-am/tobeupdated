Welcome to the **AI-enhanced** future of blogging. This post showcases various features of the *Hello Friend NG* theme.

    """Greets the user with a friendly AI message."""

print(greet("Developer"))
```

And some CSS:

```css
.ai-highlight {
  background: linear-gradient(to right, #6a11cb 0%, #2575fc 100%);
  color: white;
  padding: 1rem;
}
```
